Environmental preservation has garnered a great deal of attention in recent years. By creating a web app that calculates a building's carbon footprint, you can actively contribute to furthering the cause.

This carbon calculator combines information on floor space and annual working days with user-selected or custom attributes on building types, water fixture types, climate zones, etc.

You can then link emissions outputs to energy use, water usage, transportation, and solid waste disposal.
